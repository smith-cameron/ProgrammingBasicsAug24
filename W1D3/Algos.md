## Array: Max, Min & Avg
Write a function called `analyzeArray` that takes an array of numbers as input and logs the largest value, smallest value and average of all values.

## Array: Pop Front
Given array, remove and return the value at the beginning of the array. Do this without using any built-in array methods except pop().

## Array: Insert At
Given array, index, and additional value, insert the value into array at given index. 
Do this without using built-in array methods. 

## Array: Remove At
Given array and an index into array, remove and return the array value at that index. 
Do this without using built-in array methods except pop().
